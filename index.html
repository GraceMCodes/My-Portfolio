        As a junior developer, focusing on building a strong foundation in core
        programming languages, version control, and problem-solving is crucial.
        Becoming proficient in languages relevant to my work, mastering Git and
        GitHub for collaboration, and understanding algorithms and data
        structures are essential steps. Regularly engaging in coding challenges
        and developing real-world projects will not only enhance my skills but
        also build a robust portfolio. Contributing to open-source projects and
        gaining experience with both front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        frameworks like React) and back-end development (server-side languages
        and frameworks) will broaden my technical expertise. Additionally,
        learning to work with databases (both SQL and NoSQL) and staying updated
        with industry trends through continuous learning and attending tech
        conferences or meetups will keep me current and competitive.

      <p data-test-id="goalTwo">
        Equally important is the development of my soft skills and career
        planning. Improving my communication skills, collaborating effectively
        within a team, and understanding agile methodologies are key aspects of
        my professional growth. Seeking mentorship from experienced developers,
        actively seeking and applying feedback, and achieving relevant
        certifications can further validate my skills and knowledge. Building a
        professional network through platforms like LinkedIn and participating
        in local meetups can open doors to new opportunities. Setting career
        milestones, such as aiming for a mid-level developer position within two
        years, will help guide my progress and keep me focused on my long-term
        career objectives.
